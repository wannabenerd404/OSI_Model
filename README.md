# **The OSI Model - Deep Dive with Highest Detail**

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** provides a conceptual framework for understanding how different network protocols interact in a layered approach. Below is a deep, detailed breakdown of the 7 OSI layers, their protocols, roles, and technologies.


## **Layer 7: Application Layer**
### **Primary Function**: 
- **End-user application communication**: Provides network services directly to end-user applications, enabling them to access network resources.

### **In-depth Functions**:
