# **In-depth OSI Model Breakdown**

The **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual framework that defines the different layers of a network communication system. It divides the communication process into **7 layers**:

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
3. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
5. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**

- **Detailed Characteristics**:
  - The Session Layer ensures that long-lasting connections between applications are properly managed.
  - Handles interruptions and recovery of sessions.
  - Responsible for establishing and maintaining synchronization throughout the session, which can include features like **checkpoints** to ensure that data transfer continues after an interruption.

## **Layer 4: Transport Layer**
- **Purpose**: Responsible for ensuring the reliable transfer of data between devices and managing end-to-end communication.

- **Key Functions**:
  - **Segmentation**: Breaks large data packets into smaller segments and reassembles them at the receiving end.
  - **Error Detection and Correction**: Ensures data integrity through checksums, acknowledging successful reception of data, and retransmitting lost data.
  - **Flow Control**: Manages the rate of data transfer between sender and receiver to avoid congestion.
  - **End-to-End Communication**: Ensures that data arrives at the correct destination, error-free and in the correct order.

- **Protocols & Technologies**:
  - **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol, a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data (uses checksums, acknowledgment, and retransmissions).
  - **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol, a connectionless protocol that doesn't guarantee reliability but is faster and more efficient for some applications.
  - **SCTP**: Stream Control Transmission Protocol, used for telephony and other applications that require both reliability and low latency.

- **Detailed Characteristics**:
  - The Transport Layer is crucial for error correction and ensuring the data is delivered in sequence.
  - It provides **flow control** to avoid network congestion and allows for the management of data packets across the network.
  - **TCP** at this layer establishes a reliable connection, while **UDP** offers quicker but less reliable communication.

## **Layer 3: Network Layer**
- **Purpose**: Handles logical addressing and routing to determine how data will be delivered from the source to the destination across multiple networks.
